Files are encrypted using the AES256 algorithm, the key is encrypted with RSA2048 and sent to your server or stored in the folder with the library. I think it is worth reworking some moments, I will do it in the near future. Encryption extensions you specify yourself. I implemented only a single file encryption.

Decryption occurs due to the WinAPI function.
